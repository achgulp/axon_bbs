Of course. Here is a complete, phased implementation plan for the AxonChat federated chat room applet, incorporating all the architectural decisions we've discussed.

This plan breaks down the development into logical, testable phases, covering both the backend services and the frontend user interface.

Implementation Plan: AxonChat Applet
Phase 1: Backend Foundation
Goal: Create the necessary server-side components to manage chat rooms. This includes a new background agent, a new high-speed API endpoint for receiving messages, and the logic to activate the service.

Create New Agent Service (applets/chat_agent_service.py):

Create a new file for the ChatAgentService.

This agent will be responsible for processing chat actions, updating the AppletSharedState for the chat room, and eventually, handling federation.

For this phase, it only needs a method to handle a "new_message" action, which will add the message to the messages array in the shared state and increment the version.

Create New API Endpoint (applets/views.py):

Create a new view named UpdateStateView.

This view will handle POST requests to /api/applets/<applet_id>/update_state/.

Its sole responsibility is to receive an action from an applet, find the correct ChatAgentService instance, and pass the action to it for immediate processing.

Update URL Configuration (axon_project/urls.py):

Add a new URL pattern that routes requests for /api/applets/<applet_id>/update_state/ to the new UpdateStateView.

Update Service Manager (core/services/service_manager.py):

Modify the ServiceManager to recognize chat_agent as a valid agent username and map it to the new ChatAgentService. This allows a SysOp to activate the chat system by creating a user named chat_agent with the Is agent flag.

Phase 2: Frontend UI & Sending Messages
Goal: Build the user-facing chat applet and the client-side logic for sending messages.

Create New Applet File (frontend/src/applets/AxonChat.js):

Create the new JavaScript file for the AxonChat applet.

Build the basic React component structure for the UI: a message history panel, a user list panel, and a text input form.

Update Applet API (frontend/src/applet_api/api.js):

Add a new function, bbs.updateSharedState(action), to the applet's API helper. This function will use postMessage to send an updateState command to the AppletRunner.

Update AppletRunner (frontend/src/components/AppletRunner.js):

Add a case to the handleMessage function to process the new updateState command. When it receives this command, it will make a POST request to the new /api/applets/<applet_id>/update_state/ endpoint.

Connect UI:

In AxonChat.js, wire the text input form's onSubmit event to call the new bbs.updateSharedState() function, sending the user's message as the payload.

Phase 3: Frontend - Receiving & Displaying Messages
Goal: Implement the logic for the applet to receive and display updates from the shared state.

Implement Polling Logic (AxonChat.js):

In the AxonChat.js component, create a useEffect hook that uses setInterval to periodically call the /api/applets/<applet_id>/state_version/ endpoint (via the existing AppletRunner bridge).

Manage Local State:

The applet will hold the chat history, user list, and the current data version in its local React state.

Fetch Full State on Change:

When the polling function receives a new version number from the server that is higher than its local version, it will then make a second call to fetch the full /shared_state/ data.

Render Updates:

Upon receiving the new, complete state, the applet will update its local state, causing React to re-render the message and user lists, displaying the new content to all users in the room.

Phase 4: Federation Logic
Goal: Enable the ChatAgentService to synchronize the chat room state across all federated BBS instances.

Implement Peer Polling (applets/chat_agent_service.py):

In the main loop of the ChatAgentService, add logic to iterate through all trusted peers.

For each peer, the agent will make an authenticated API call to that peer's /api/applets/<applet_id>/state_version/ endpoint for the same chat room applet.

Implement State Synchronization:

If the agent detects that a remote peer has a newer version of the chat state, it will make a second API call to that peer's /shared_state/ endpoint to download the complete data.

Implement State Merging:

The agent will then perform a merge operation: it will combine its local message history with the history received from the peer, remove any duplicate messages, and sort the final list by timestamp to ensure correct chronological order.

It will then update its own local AppletSharedState with this merged data and the new, higher version number. This change is then automatically picked up and displayed by the local applets on its own BBS.
