Of course. It's a good idea to recap the features we were working on. Here is a summary of the new gameplay mechanics we planned and implemented between the stable version v7.2 and our most recent attempts.

Essentially, we moved from a basic command system to a much deeper and more realistic logistics simulation.

Drone Travel Time & Logistics:

Instead of instantly arriving at their destination, drones were upgraded to have a speed attribute.

The agent now calculates the distance to a target and simulates the drone traveling across the map over several "world ticks."

You can see the drones physically moving on the strategic map each time your applet gets an update from the server.

Dedicated Drone Tasks:

We changed the logic so that a drone is now dedicated to a single task (like Constructing or Harvesting) until it is complete or is given a new order.

Construction progress only advances if a drone remains assigned to the site, making drone allocation a key strategic decision.

Task Interruption and Cancellation:

To manage the new dedicated tasks, we added a confirmation system. If you try to give a new order to a busy drone, a modal window now asks if you want to cancel its current task.

Canceling a construction task correctly refunds a portion of the resources and removes the construction site.

The "STOP" Command:

We added a "STOP" button to the UNITS panel. This command halts a drone's current action (traveling, building, etc.) and sets its status back to "Idle" at its current location on the map.

Communication Range & Autonomous Operation:

We introduced the concept of a Command Center's comm_range.

When a drone travels outside this range, it continues to execute its last given command but can no longer receive new orders (like "STOP" or a new build task).

The applet was updated to draw a visual circle for the comms range on the map and change the icon for any drones that are out of contact.

Procedural 3D Replays:

We designed and implemented a system for the agent to generate "replay data" for key events like a construction completion.

The applet was upgraded to include a three.js-based "replay player" that uses this data to generate a real-time, 3D animated "video" of the event in the Video Playback Screen.

These features represent a significant leap in gameplay depth. Now that we have a reliable way to reset the game state with the FORCE RESET button, we can safely move forward with re-implementing and testing these mechanics.
