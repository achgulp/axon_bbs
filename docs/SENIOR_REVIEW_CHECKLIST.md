### Console Output
Expected:
```
Generating terrain...
Terrain generated with 5120 vertices
Test cube placed at height: [some number 0-8]
```

### Performance

```
‚úÖ Task 1.2 APPROVED

Outstanding terrain implementation! The heightmap looks great:
- Strategic features are clearly visible
- Plateau provides tactical high ground
- Starting zones are appropriately flat
- Noise generation creates natural variation
- Lighting shows elevation beautifully

The test cube correctly follows terrain height, proving your `getHeightAt()` function works.

Performance is good at 5,120 vertices - well within browser capabilities.

You may proceed to Task 1.3 (Ground Units).
```

  - Scout: BoxGeometry 1√ó0.4√ó1.5
- [ ] Materials use player colors
- [ ] Meshes cast shadows
- [ ] Units added to scene

- [ ] `update()` called every frame with deltaTime
- [ ] Units move at correct speed (stats.speed * deltaTime)
- [ ] Movement direction calculated correctly
- [ ] Units rotate to face movement direction
- [ ] Units stop at destination
- [ ] Terrain height updated during movement

### Animation Loop

### Console Output
Expected:
```
Initializing unit system...
Created TANK unit #unit_0 for player 0
Created ARTILLERY unit #unit_1 for player 1
Created SCOUT unit #unit_2 for player 0
Unit system initialized with 3 test units
```

### Approval Comments

If APPROVED:
```
‚úÖ Task 1.3 APPROVED

Fantastic work on the unit system! This is the foundation of the gameplay.

What you've accomplished:
- Clean unit data structure
- Proper terrain-following (units climb hills realistically)
- Smooth movement with rotation
- Delta-time based movement (frame-rate independent)
- Good visual variety (different shapes per unit type)

The moving scout proves your movement system works correctly. I can see it:
- Moves smoothly
- Rotates to face direction
- Follows terrain elevation changes
- Stops at destination

This is professional-quality code. Well done!

## Common Issues to Watch For

### Junior Dev Mistakes

1. **Forgot BBS API Helper**
   - Missing or modified the helper code
   - Fix: Copy exact template

2. **Wrong File Path**
   - Created file in wrong directory
   - Fix: Move to correct location

3. **Syntax Errors**
   - Missing semicolons, braces, etc.
   - Fix: Run through ESLint

4. **Not Following Template**
   - Modified template code unnecessarily
   - Fix: Revert to template, then add their changes

5. **No Error Handling**
   - Missing try/catch blocks
   - Fix: Wrap async code in try/catch

6. **Hardcoded Values**
   - Not using constants or config
   - Fix: Use UNIT_STATS, TerrainSystem.size, etc.

7. **Performance Issues**
   - Creating too many objects
   - Not cleaning up
   - Fix: Object pooling, proper disposal

8. **Not Testing**
   - Submitted without verifying it works
   - Fix: Require screenshots/video proof

### Red Flags

üö© Code that looks copy-pasted without understanding
üö© No console logs (means they can't debug)
üö© Vague submission messages ("I did the thing")
üö© Defensive responses to feedback
üö© Skipping steps or tasks
üö© Asking to proceed before approval

---

## Success Metrics

A junior dev is doing well if:
- ‚úÖ Follows instructions precisely
- ‚úÖ Asks good questions when stuck
- ‚úÖ Tests before submitting
- ‚úÖ Accepts feedback gracefully
- ‚úÖ Learns from mistakes
- ‚úÖ Code quality improves over time

---

**Remember:** The goal is to teach, not just to get code. Be patient, be thorough, be encouraging!
