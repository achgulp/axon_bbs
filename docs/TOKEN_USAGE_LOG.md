## Current Status

**Latest Update:** Session ending - Tasks 0-1.3 complete, 80% of Week 1 done!
**Tokens Used:** 128,339 (64.2%)
**Tokens Remaining:** 71,661 (35.8%)
**Status:** ‚úÖ GOOD - Safe to continue next session with Task 1.4

## Usage Breakdown

### Planning Phase (0-53k tokens) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Initial planning discussions
- Created implementation plan (~20k words)
- Created onboarding guide (~8k words)
- Created task breakdown (~6k words)
- Created review checklist (~4k words)
- Created session summaries
- Updated claude.md with Gemini Flash/Pro workflow
- Created START_GEMINI_TASK_0.sh script (Flash)
- Created START_GEMINI_TASK_0_PRO.sh script (Pro)
- Created GEMINI_MODEL_GUIDE.md (~5k words)
- Set up token monitoring system
- Tested Gemini CLI integration
- Updated all docs with two-tier model system
- **Result:** Complete documentation ready, dual-model workflow configured
- **Actual Usage:** 53k tokens (still much better than estimated 120k!)

### Checkpoint Targets

| Milestone | Token Target | Actual | Status |
|-----------|--------------|--------|--------|

## Token Conservation Strategy

### What We're Doing RIGHT ‚úÖ

1. **Using Gemini Flash for Implementation**
   - Gemini writes the code
   - Claude Code reviews only
   - Saves 60-70% of tokens

2. **Batch Reviews**
   - Review multiple tasks together
   - More efficient than one-by-one

3. **Clear Templates**
   - Junior devs follow templates
   - Less back-and-forth = fewer tokens

### Estimated Token Budget

**If following Gemini workflow:**

| Activity | Claude Tokens | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Planning | 120k | ‚úÖ Already done |
| Review Task 0-1.3 | ~15k | Gemini does work, Claude reviews |
| Review Tasks 1.4-1.5 | ~10k | Continuing Week 1 |
| Review Week 2 (2.1-2.5) | ~20k | Air combat tasks |
| Review Week 3 (3.1-3.5) | ~15k | Asset integration |
| Review Week 4 (4.1-4.5) | ~20k | Multiplayer |
| **TOTAL ESTIMATE** | **~200k** | ‚úÖ Should fit! |

**Key Insight:** By using Gemini for implementation, we can complete the entire 4-week project within token budget!

## Auto-Save Procedure

When tokens reach **170,000** (85%), I will automatically:

1. **Update this log** with current status
2. **Update SESSION_SUMMARY.md** with:
   - Current task
   - What's completed
   - What's next
   - Any blockers
3. **Create checkpoint file** with restoration instructions
4. **Notify you** with clear next steps

---

## Monitoring Schedule

I check token usage after every major activity:
- ‚úÖ After each task review
- ‚úÖ After architectural discussions
- ‚úÖ After creating large documents
- ‚úÖ Before starting new major work

**Current Plan:**
- Continue with normal workflow
- Monitor after each Gemini task review
- Auto-save at 170k threshold
- Reserve 30k tokens for emergency buffer

## Token Usage Tips

**For You (Project Manager):**
- Use Gemini for implementation (saves my tokens)
- Batch multiple questions together
- Reference existing docs instead of asking me to explain again

**For Me (Claude Code):**
- Keep reviews concise but thorough
- Reference checklist items instead of repeating them
- Use bullet points instead of long prose
- Save detailed explanations for complex issues only

---

## Restoration After Auto-Save

If I hit 85% and save:

**Start new session with:**
```
Resume Warzone Lite as senior architect.
Read: docs/CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_SUMMARY.md
Current checkpoint: [I'll tell you in the save message]
Let's continue!
```

**Last Updated:** Flash/Pro workflow complete (54k tokens used)
**Next Check:** After reviewing Gemini's Task 0 submission
**Status:** üü¢ Excellent - Dual-model system ready, development phase can begin
