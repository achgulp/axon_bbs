Axon BBS - Project Brief & Development Context (Version 10.27.0)
Version: 10.27.0

Last Updated: 2025-10-15

Project Summary
Axon BBS is a federated, anonymous, and modern bulletin board system. The core architecture is a Django backend with a React single-page application frontend. Key systems include a custom P2P data synchronization protocol (BitSync) and a sandboxed applet framework for extensibility. The applet framework has recently been hardened to include client-side integrity verification and support for a hybrid architecture for large, complex applications.

Developer Tools
The project includes management commands to streamline applet development and deployment:

post_applet_update: Automates the process of posting applet updates to the "Applet Library" message board with proper BitSync manifests. This command creates the necessary FileAttachment with encrypted content, posts a formatted message with installation instructions, and automatically updates the applet's code_manifest in the database.

check_applet_manifest: Diagnostic tool to verify applet manifests and troubleshoot federation issues.

Immediate To-Do List / Roadmap
This is the prioritized list of features to be implemented next:

Implement Federated Chat (AxonChat):

Build the frontend applet UI for sending and receiving messages.

Implement the backend agent logic to federate chat state across the network.

Implement User-Managed Applets:

Add an owner (ForeignKey to User), is_active (BooleanField), and required_access_level (PositiveIntegerField) to the Applet model.

Create a new frontend view for users to upload and manage their own applets.

Implement Universal Embed Framework:

Refactor the frontend's AttachmentRenderer to dynamically launch viewer applets based on MIME type.

Integrate Browser History:

Refactor the frontend to use the React Router library to manage navigation and browser history.
