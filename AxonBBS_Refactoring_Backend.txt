✦ Excellent. Let's begin the refactoring process.

  I will start by reviewing the "Core Principles" and "Backend Architecture: Feature Domains" sections of the AxonBBS_ArchBlueprint_10.21.0.txt file to understand
  the desired modular architecture. Then, I will analyze the current backend structure and propose a detailed, one-shot refactoring plan.

  First, I will read the architectural blueprint.

✦ Excellent. I have analyzed the architectural blueprint and the current codebase. The goal is to refactor the backend from two large apps (core and api) into smaller,
  feature-focused apps: accounts, messaging, applets, and federation.

  This is a significant refactoring. A true "one-shot" operation would be very large and risky. I propose we break it down into four distinct phases, each of which
  can be executed as a single, verifiable "one-shot" operation:

   * Phase 1: Create New App Structure. I will create the new Django apps and update the project settings.
   * Phase 2: Move Models & Handle Migrations. I will move the Django models to their new apps and generate the necessary database migrations.
   * Phase 3: Move Views, Serializers, and URLs. I will move the API endpoints and their related serializers to the new apps.
   * Phase 4: Move Services. I will move the business logic services to their new homes.

  After each phase, I will run the UAT suite to ensure that we have not introduced any regressions.

  If you approve of this phased approach, I will begin with Phase 1: Create New App Structure. I will create the new accounts, messaging, applets, and federation
  apps and add them to your settings.py.

  Shall I proceed?
