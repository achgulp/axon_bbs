Axon BBS - Product Requirements Document (Version 10.27.0)
Version: 10.27.0

Last Updated: 2025-10-15

Overview
Axon BBS is an anonymous, modern bulletin board system that operates on a private, federated network of trusted nodes. The platform is built with a focus on user privacy and resilience, utilizing a custom peer-to-peer data synchronization protocol called BitSync and a sandboxed Applet Framework for extensible, rich content.

Key features and architectural pillars in this version include:
- Unified Moderation Hub: A single, streamlined interface for all moderator duties.
- Universal Embed Framework: A system to allow any file type to be viewed directly within messages using dedicated, secure applets.
- User-Managed Applets: Functionality for users to upload and manage their own applets.
- Federated Chat: A near-real-time chat system allowing users from different BBS instances to communicate in shared rooms.
- Browser History Integration: A plan to prevent the browser's back button from exiting the application unexpectedly.
- Dynamic Agent Loading: A flexible, database-driven system for configuring and launching backend services.
- Automated Configuration Cloning: A one-click tool for SysOps to bootstrap a new BBS instance from a trusted peer.
- New: Secure Applet Loading: A robust, client-side integrity check that verifies the checksum of all applet code before execution, preventing corrupted or tampered code from running.
- New: Hybrid Applet Architecture: Support for complex applications by allowing applet code to be packaged separately from its heavy assets (models, textures, sounds), which are loaded on demand.

User Roles & Stories

As a User...

I want to generate or import my cryptographic identity to securely and anonymously interact with the system.

I want to upload a profile avatar to personalize my identity.

I want to send and receive E2E encrypted private messages.

I want to post on public message boards and attach files, including videos and images.

I want to view content like videos and images directly within a message thread instead of having to download them.

I want to run sandboxed games and applications (applets) securely.

New: I want to be sure that the applets I run have not been corrupted or tampered with during download.

I want to upload and manage my own applets to share with the community.

I want to report a message that violates the rules to help keep the community clean.

I want to contact the moderators with a general question or concern that isn't about a specific message.

I want the browser's back button to navigate within the BBS instead of exiting the site completely.

I want to claim my federated, inactive account on a new BBS by proving ownership with my private key.

I want to see available chat rooms listed alongside regular message boards.

I want to join a chat room by launching an applet from a designated message board.

I want to send messages to the room in near-real-time.

I want to see a list of other users currently in the chat room.

As a Moderator...

I want to have all the powers of a standard User.

I want a single "Unified Moderation Hub" where I can see all pending tasks in one place.

In my queue, I want to see different types of tickets: message reports, profile approvals, and general user inquiries.

I want to approve valid reports, which purges the message from the network and awards karma to the reporter.

I want to review and approve or deny user-submitted profile updates.

When I close a general inquiry, I want the system to automatically send a PM acknowledgment to the user.

As a Developer...

I want to use the post_applet_update management command to quickly deploy applet updates with proper BitSync manifests.

I want the command to automatically create FileAttachments, post to the "Applet Library" board, and update the applet's code_manifest in one operation.

I want posted updates to include version information, file hashes, and installation instructions for complete traceability.

I want to use the check_applet_manifest command to diagnose issues with applet manifests and federation.

As a SysOp (System Operator/Admin)...

I want all the powers of a standard User and Moderator.

I want to manage a whitelist of trusted federated peers to control synchronization.

I want to associate a viewer applet with the MIME types it is designed to handle.

New: I want to configure a complex applet (like a large game) by linking it to a separate asset package (.zip file) via its parameters, allowing for a hybrid loading architecture.

New: I want the system to seamlessly support both simple (all-in-one) and complex (hybrid) applet formats without needing to re-package old applets.

I want to create a new chat room by creating a MessageBoard and assigning the AxonChat Applet to its "Event Bus" field.

I want to define the code path for an agent service directly on its user account in the admin panel.

I want to configure agent-specific parameters (like poll intervals) directly on the agent's user account.

I want to initialize a new, empty BBS instance by cloning the user and application configuration from a trusted peer.

When cloning a configuration, I want the system to automatically skip importing any superuser accounts from the peer.

When cloning a configuration, I want the system to automatically generate new, unique default avatars for all imported users.
