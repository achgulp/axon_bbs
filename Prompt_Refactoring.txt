Of course. Let's finalize the plan before we begin. Here is the proposed workflow for our one-shot refactoring sessions:

  Refactoring Workflow

   1. You Define the Goal: You will tell me what part of the project you want to refactor and what the high-level goal is (e.g., "Refactor the authentication views to
      be more modular," or "Improve the performance of the message list view").

   2. I Analyze and Plan: I will thoroughly analyze the relevant files, including the source code, related tests, and any other dependencies. Based on this analysis, I
      will propose a detailed, "one-shot" plan that outlines:
       * The specific files to be modified.
       * The exact changes I will make.
       * The verification steps I will take (e.g., running tests, linters).

   3. You Approve: You will review the plan. We can make any necessary adjustments at this stage.

   4. I Execute: Once you approve the plan, I will execute all the code modifications in a single turn.

   5. I Verify with UAT: After the changes are implemented, I will run the full UAT suite to ensure that the refactoring has not introduced any regressions or broken
      any core functionality.

  This process is designed to be as efficient as possible, minimizing back-and-forth and ensuring that we maintain a stable codebase throughout the refactoring.

  If this plan looks good to you, please let me know what you would like to refactor first.
