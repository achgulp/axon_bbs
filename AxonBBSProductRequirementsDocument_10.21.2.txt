Axon BBS - Product Requirements Document (Version 10.21.2)
Version: 10.21.2

Last Updated: 2025-10-02

Overview
Axon BBS is an anonymous, modern bulletin board system that operates on a private, federated network of trusted nodes. The platform is built with a focus on user privacy and resilience, utilizing a custom peer-to-peer data synchronization protocol called BitSync and a sandboxed Applet Framework for extensible, rich content.

Key features and architectural pillars in this version include:
    - Unified Moderation Hub: A single, streamlined interface for all moderator duties.
    - Universal Embed Framework: A system to allow any file type to be viewed directly within messages using dedicated, secure applets.
    - User-Managed Applets: Functionality for users to upload and manage their own applets.
    - Federated Chat: A near-real-time chat system allowing users from different BBS instances to communicate in shared rooms.
    - Browser History Integration: A plan to prevent the browser's back button from exiting the application unexpectedly.
    - New: Dynamic Agent Loading: A flexible, database-driven system for configuring and launching backend services.
    - New: Automated Configuration Cloning: A one-click tool for SysOps to bootstrap a new BBS instance from a trusted peer.

New: I want to create a new chat room by creating a MessageBoard and assigning the AxonChat Applet to its "Event Bus" field.
New: I want to define the code path for an agent service directly on its user account in the admin panel, so I don't have to modify the source code to add new agents.
New: I want to configure agent-specific parameters (like poll intervals) directly on the agent's user account for flexible tuning.
New: I want to initialize a new, empty BBS instance by cloning the user and application configuration from a trusted peer using a single admin action.
