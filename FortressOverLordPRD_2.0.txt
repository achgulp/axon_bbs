Fortress Overlord - Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Version: 2.0
Date: September 1, 2025
Game Type: Asynchronous, Persistent Real-Time Strategy (RTS) Applet

1. Core Concept & Lore
In the year 2342, Earth is a graveyard. Centuries of war and environmental collapse have left the planet barren, its population struggling for survival. Humanity has not fled; it is trapped. The stars are a distant dream, but the inner planets offer a desperate lifeline. Your mission is not one of colonization for a new home, but of extraction for the old one. You have been sent to the hellish, high-pressure atmosphere of Venus to build and command an autonomous fortress, a vital outpost designed to harvest the resources Earth so desperately needs to begin a multi-generational rebuilding effort.

As a Commander, you will not command units in real-time; instead, you will act as an overseer, issuing high-level commands, programming drone AI, and managing your industrial base from the first-person perspective of your Command Center console. Actions are resolved by a server-side Overlord Agent while you are offline. Success depends on strategic planning, robust automation, and logistical efficiency to keep the resource pipeline to Earth flowing.

2. The Gameplay Loop
The core gameplay is a cycle of planning, execution, and analysis:

Assess: Log in to your console and review the Command Log. This contains all after-action reports and status updates from your drones and the Overlord Agent that occurred while you were offline.

Manage: Access management panels to upgrade buildings, construct new drones, and manage resource production queues.

Command: Issue specific, task-based commands to your drones (e.g., "Harvest," "Build," "Patrol") by selecting a drone and then a target on the strategic map.

Program (Future): Design and assign AI scripts to drones to automate complex behaviors.

Await Results: Log off. The Overlord Agent resolves your commands and simulates your fortress's operation over time. You discover the outcomes upon your next login.

3. The Console User Interface (UI)
The player experience is entirely confined to a retro-futuristic, console-based UI within the Command Center, reinforcing the role of a remote commander.

Central Multi-Purpose Screen: Toggles between a Strategic Map, a Building Management list, and a Unit Roster.

System Status Panel: Displays real-time gauges for the fortress's internal temperature, pressure, oxygen, and power levels.

Telemetry Panel:

Video Playback Screen: A small, low-fidelity screen for replaying Procedural After-Action Reportsâ€”3D-rendered animations of key events generated from agent data.

Sensor Feed: Displays detailed information about a selected unit or building.

Command Log: A scrolling text log of all events, commands, and agent reports. Clickable links on certain events will trigger the playback of their corresponding after-action report.

4. Resources & Production Chain
The economy is based on a realistic, multi-stage production chain.

Raw Ore: The base raw material, gathered from Ore Deposits on the map by drones assigned to a Crystal Mine.

Crystals: A refined component produced by a Forge/Smelter. It consumes Raw Ore to create industrial-grade crystals essential for all high-tech construction.

Refined Metal: (Future) Produced by the Forge/Smelter, likely consuming Raw Ore and Crystals. The primary material for advanced units and structures.

Hydrogen: (Future) A rare gas extracted from Hydrogen Geysers.

Atmospheric Gas: (Future) Harvested directly from the Venusian atmosphere.

5. Drones & Logistics
Drones are the player's hands in the world. They are fully autonomous but require clear commands.

Single-Tasking: A drone can only perform one task at a time (e.g., traveling, harvesting, constructing). Issuing a new command to a busy drone requires confirmation and will cancel its current task.

Positional Tracking & Travel Time: Drones have a physical location on the map and a defined speed. When tasked, a drone must travel from its current location to its target. The agent calculates travel time based on distance and the drone's speed, simulating the journey over multiple world ticks.

Logistics Loop: A drone tasked to harvest will:

Travel to the target resource node.

Harvest until its cargo is full.

Automatically travel back to the Command Center to deposit resources.

Return to the resource node to continue harvesting.

Communication Range: The Command Center projects a communications bubble of a fixed radius.

In Range: Drones within this range can receive new commands (e.g., "STOP") and send back real-time status updates.

Out of Range: A drone that travels outside this range will continue to execute its last valid command but cannot receive new ones. It will buffer any after-action reports and deliver them in a burst upon returning to communication range. On the map, it is visually marked as "out-of-contact."

6. Buildings & Construction
All structures are built by drones at player-specified locations.

Drone-Initiated Construction: To build, a player selects a drone, issues a "BUILD" command for a specific structure (e.g., "Greenhouse"), and then clicks a location on the map.

Construction Sites: The Overlord Agent creates a "Construction Site" at the target location. The selected drone travels to this site to initiate construction. Once started, the drone is freed up for new tasks.

Autonomous Construction: The construction site builds itself automatically over a number of world ticks defined in the game's configuration. Progress is visible on the map and in the building management panel.

Completion: When progress is complete, the agent replaces the site with the finished building and posts a "Construction Complete" report, which may include a playable 3D replay.

7. Core Systems & Vulnerabilities
Double-Loop Cooling: All drones and buildings require a cooling system to operate in the extreme Venusian heat. This is a critical vulnerability that can be targeted in future combat.

Power Management: All structures require energy to function. The player starts with a single fission generator and must expand their power grid to support their growing fortress.

Marauders: NPC raiders, likely remnants of other failed colonization efforts, will periodically attack the player's fortress, creating a constant source of pressure and a need for defensive structures.
