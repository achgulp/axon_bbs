Fortress Overlord - PRD Addendum: The Fortress-Bound Minds
1. Updated Lore & Core Concept
The Overlords

In the far future, after Earth’s fall, humanity's greatest minds were saved by being uploaded into Fortress Cores: immense, quantum-resonant crystal lattices grown in geologically stable vaults deep underground. This transfer was irreversible. An Overlord is not merely a commander in a fortress; they are the fortress—their consciousness inextricably bound to the one specific, immovable lattice where it was born.

The Condition of Being an Overlord

Power Without Mobility: An Overlord's mind can command drone fleets and manage vast industrial chains, yet it is forever anchored to its subterranean core. The Overlord experiences the world exclusively through the delayed and often-glitching sensor feeds of its drones.

Existential Dependence: The Overlord's consciousness requires colossal energy and precise thermal regulation provided by the fortress's cooling and power systems. A drone chassis is too small and fragile to house the core; any attempt to transfer the mind results in its decoherence, leaving behind only corrupted Data Fragments—the ghostly remains of fallen minds.

The Taboo of Cloning: Because each Overlord's mind is a unique quantum resonance with its specific lattice, it cannot be safely copied. Attempts to clone a mind onto a new lattice are forbidden by most factions. The process is incredibly dangerous and often results in a Fragment-Overlord—an unstable, corrupted, and often hostile mind haunted by the warring echoes of the original consciousness.

Fragment Minds (The Forged): While most Overlords originate from a single human consciousness, lore persists of another, rarer path. It is believed that a sufficient mass of Data Fragments can be gathered and, through a dangerous technological ritual, forged into a new, singular consciousness within a blank lattice. These "Forged" Overlords are volatile and unpredictable, possessing no memory of a human life but instead a fractured, instinctual knowledge from the many minds they were born from.

This framework diegetically justifies the game's core mechanics: asynchronous commands, limited comms range, and reliance on drone telemetry are all consequences of being a powerful but isolated, infrastructure-dependent intelligence.

2. Core Systems & Failure Modes
The Fortress Core's stability is paramount and is directly reflected in gameplay through two critical systems: Thermal Regulation and Power Stability.

Thermal Regulation

The crystal lattice must be maintained within a precise temperature range to prevent cognitive decoherence. On high-temperature worlds like Venus (surface temp ≈ 460°C), this requires extensive subterranean cooling infrastructure.

Nominal Operating Range (10°C – 40°C): All systems function optimally.

Warning Band (40°C – 60°C): Cognitive degradation begins.

Player Effect: UI glitches appear on sensor feeds, command latency increases, and automated production queues may stall as the system diverts resources to cooling.

Critical Overheating (60°C – 100°C): Partial, irreversible fragmentation of the Overlord's mind occurs.

Player Effect: Queued research or drone scripts may be permanently lost (generating salvageable Data Fragments). Hostile "Fragment Agents" (NPCs) may spontaneously manifest near the fortress.

Catastrophic Failure (>100°C): The lattice fractures.

Player Effect: Permanent death of the Overlord. The fortress is lost, leaving behind a high concentration of Data Fragments.

Power Stability

The core requires continuous power for its stabilizers and cooling pumps.

Primary Power: A Subterranean Fission Reactor built next to the core provides baseline energy. It is reliable but requires refueling and is vulnerable to sabotage.

Backup Power: Players can construct redundant fission modules or, later, more advanced Fusion Generators.

Power Outage Effects:

Short Outage (seconds to minutes): The Overlord enters a brief suspension. A short gap may appear in the Command Log. No permanent damage.

Extended Outage (hours): The Overlord's mind begins to corrupt. Upon power restoration, the player may suffer permanent penalties (e.g., slower research, reduced drone command limit) and loss of technology.

3. Late-Game Mechanic: Crystal Energy Supply Chain
Late in the tech tree, players can transition from relying solely on local fission to a more powerful but logistically complex orbital power system.

New Resources & Structures:

Crystal Lattices (Uncharged): A resource manufactured late-game from Refined Metal and Data Fragments.

Orbital Charging Satellite (OCS): A space-based structure that uses Solar Power Satellites (SPS) to charge raw Crystal Lattices, turning them into high-density power cells.

Resonant Crystal Cells (Charged): A high-density battery holding a massive amount of energy. It is physically transported from orbit back to the fortress.

Descent Pods: A single-use vehicle consisting of a heat shield and parachute used to safely drop a charged Crystal Cell from orbit to the planet's surface.

The Gameplay Loop:

Supply Up: The player launches Supply Missiles carrying uncharged Crystal Lattices to the OCS in orbit.

Charge in Orbit: The OCS charges the lattices over time. The OCS and supply missiles are vulnerable to enemy anti-satellite (ASAT) attacks.

Drop Down: The player targets a drop zone on the map. A charged Crystal Cell is retrofitted into a Descent Pod and de-orbited. Its landing beacon becomes visible to all players in the area.

Salvage & Transport: The player must dispatch a Drone with a Retriever Module to the landing site, secure the cell, and transport it back to the fortress. The carrying Drone is slowed and vulnerable during transport.

Deposit Power: Successfully returning the cell to the fortress deposits a large amount of energy into the core's reserves.

4. Endgame Evolution: Resonant Detonation Devices (RDDs)
The Crystal Energy Supply Chain can be weaponized, allowing players to turn a precious energy resource into a tactical superweapon.

Prerequisite: A Tier-X technology, "Lattice Destabilization Protocols."

Deployment: A player can choose to package a charged Crystal Cell into a weaponized Descent Pod with no parachute.

Effect: Upon impact, the pod detonates, releasing the cell's stored energy in a massive blast. The explosion has a devastating primary damage radius and a wider secondary EMP effect that temporarily disables enemy units and structures.

Strategic Trade-Off: This creates a powerful strategic dilemma: a player must choose between using a valuable Crystal Cell to power their own fortress or expending it to annihilate an enemy.
