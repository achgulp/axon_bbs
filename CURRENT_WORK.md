## What I'm Working On Right Now

### Primary: Bee Adventure (FPS Game)
**Status:** In active development with AntiGravity engine
**Location:** External to Axon BBS (not yet ported)

**Current Tasks:**
- [ ] Finish core gameplay mechanics
  - [x] Basic bee movement and controls
  - [ ] Pollen collection system
  - [ ] Water collection system
  - [ ] Nectar collection system
- [ ] Add AI bees
  - [ ] Friendly bee AI
  - [ ] Hive defense behaviors
- [ ] Add NPCs
  - [ ] Enemy bees/creatures
  - [ ] NPC behaviors and patterns
- [ ] Polish single-player experience

**When This is Done:**
→ Port to Axon BBS as sandboxed applet
→ Build FPSNetcode library for multiplayer

---

## Secondary: Axon BBS Maintenance

### Monitoring
- ✅ 60fps dual-loop architecture running smoothly
- ✅ Warzone Lite multiplayer tested and stable
- ✅ AxonChat federation working

### Minor Updates
- No active development
- Responding to bugs/issues as they arise

---

## Near Future (Next 2-4 Weeks)

1. **Complete Bee Adventure single-player** (Focus)
2. **Test and polish Bee Adventure** gameplay
3. **Plan Axon BBS port** (review applet framework)

---

## Medium Future (1-3 Months)

1. **Port Bee Adventure to Axon BBS**
   - Package code and assets via BitSync
   - Integrate window.bbs API
   - Test single-player applet
   - Publish to Applet Library

2. **Start AxonNetcode Library**
   - Design FPSNetcode based on Bee Adventure needs
   - Build core AxonNetcode.js
   - Implement client prediction
   - Add interpolation utilities
   - Test with Bee Adventure multiplayer

---

## Blockers / Waiting On

- ❌ None currently
- Bee Adventure development is the critical path

---

## Recently Completed (Last 7 Days)

- ✅ Reviewed Axon BBS project status
- ✅ Created NETCODE_ROADMAP.md for future planning
- ✅ Confirmed Warzone Lite is production-ready
- ✅ Verified 60fps architecture is working
- ✅ Updated project documentation

## Notes for Future AI Sessions

**If you're resuming work on Bee Adventure:**
- Game is being developed with AntiGravity (external)
- Focus on single-player completion
- Multiplayer will come later via FPSNetcode

**If you're resuming work on Axon BBS:**
- 60fps system is complete and working
- Warzone Lite is done (don't rebuild it)
- Next major BBS work is Bee Adventure port
- See PROJECT_STATUS.md for full context

**If you're working on netcode library:**
- Don't start yet - wait for Bee Adventure
- Roadmap is in docs/NETCODE_ROADMAP.md
- Should be driven by actual game needs, not speculation

## Quick Context Restoration

**For AI Assistants:**

1. **Check this file** for active work
2. **Read PROJECT_STATUS.md** for overall status
3. **Review git log** for recent changes
4. **Ask clarifying questions** before making assumptions

**Key Points:**
- Bee Adventure ≠ in Axon BBS (yet)
- Warzone Lite = complete
- 60fps = working
- Netcode library = future work
