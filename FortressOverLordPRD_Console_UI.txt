Console User Interface (UI) Specification
The Command Center's UI is designed as a first-person, console-based experience. The player is confined to the command dome and interacts with the world solely through the console, reinforcing the strategic, commander-in-chief role. The UI is not a live feed but a display of telemetry and data packets, emphasizing the asynchronous nature of the game. The aesthetic is a blend of retro-futuristic and rugged, utilitarian design, with physical controls complementing digital displays.

1. Core Console Components
Physical Console: A large, curved desk made of weathered, gunmetal-gray steel with exposed rivets and heavy-duty wiring. This provides a raw, industrial feel.

Keyboard & Trackball: A clunky, mechanical keyboard for text input (e.g., renaming Drones, inputting commands) and a simple, heavy trackball for navigation.

Physical Toggles: A bank of physical switches and toggles for issuing high-level commands. Each switch would have a satisfying click and a physical state.

Emergency Indicator: A large, red, flashing light mounted on top of the console. This light is activated only during a critical, life-threatening emergency, such as a command center breach, critical power loss, or a catastrophic cooling system failure.

2. Central Multi-Purpose Screen
This large, amber-colored screen is the player's primary window into the game world. It is the central hub for all strategic management and can be toggled between different views:

Strategic Map View: A top-down, wireframe map of the fortress and surrounding territory, showing the location of Drones, resources, and known enemy positions. The map is not a live feed and is only updated when a Drone reports back with new telemetry data.

Building Management View: An interface for queuing upgrades, managing production in the Forge/Smelter and Robot Factory, and constructing new buildings like greenhouses.

Unit Roster & Status View: A list of all Drones. A toggle will switch to a detailed view of a selected Drone, showing a wireframe schematic. Damaged components will be highlighted in orange (minor damage) or red (critical damage/non-functional).

AI Scripting Interface: The block-based puzzle layout for creating and editing AI scripts. Players will drag and drop commands and verbs that snap together logically, eliminating the need for traditional programming.

3. Left-Side Display & Gauges
This section provides critical, real-time feedback on the fortress's status and is dedicated to more visual forms of data.

Video Playback Screen: A smaller, grainy, low-frame-rate screen dedicated to replaying recorded video feeds from a selected Drone's camera. This is used for after-action reports and for a more visceral view of events that have already occurred.

System Gauges: A bank of analog gauges with flickering needles that provide at-a-glance information on the fortress's core systems:

Internal Pressure: Shows the internal pressure of the Command Center dome. A rapid increase in pressure is a direct indicator of a leak or breach, as Venus's external atmosphere rushes in.

Internal Temperature: Displays the temperature inside the Command Center. A rise in temperature indicates a failure in the cooling system, which could lead to critical failure.

Oxygen Levels: Tracks the air quality and oxygen supply within the dome.

Energy Production: Shows the total power being generated from all sources (solar, fission, fusion) and total energy consumed.

4. Data Flow and Feedback
Asynchronous Telemetry: All data, from sensor feeds to after-action reports, is received in data packets. A visible timer on the UI shows the age of the data (e.g., "Data received: 2 minutes ago").

Sensor Data Display: When a Drone is selected, the player can toggle between its different sensor feeds on the main screen. This includes a seismograph display for gyroscopic vibration analysis, a wireframe map for LIDAR, and a sweeping radar screen for moving targets.

UI Degradation: The UI itself serves as a warning system. Damage to a Drone's sensors would be reflected as glitches or static on the video and radar screens. Damage to the Command Center's systems could cause the gauges to malfunction or flicker, signaling a need for repair.

Command Log: A scrolling text log provides a detailed history of all events, from successful harvests to enemy encounters. This is where the player would review after-action reports from the Overlord Agent.
