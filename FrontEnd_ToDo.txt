Does the frontend need any changes?



Show thinking
Yes, based on the latest product requirements document, the frontend is missing two key features that are unrelated to Karma.

Credential Management on Profile Page
The user profile page is missing the forms for password and security question management. According to the product requirements, users should be able to:

Change their password from their profile page.

Reset their security questions from their profile page.

The current 

ProfileScreen.js component does not include the UI elements (forms and buttons) necessary to perform these actions.

Moderator Approval Queue for Profiles
The 

ModerationDashboard.js component only displays the queue for reported messages. A required feature for moderators is the ability to review and approve profile updates (nicknames and avatars) before they are federated across the network.



The dashboard needs a new section to display these pending 

update_profile actions and allow moderators to approve or deny them.
