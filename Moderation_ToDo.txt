Based on the backend code we've implemented, the remaining work to complete the moderation features is entirely on the frontend user interface. The API endpoints and database models are now in place to support the full workflow.

Here is what's left to do on the frontend:

## 1. Build the Moderator Dashboard
This is the main component for moderators. It would be a new page or view in the application, accessible only to users with the is_moderator flag set to True.

Fetch Pending Reports: The dashboard needs to make an API call to /api/moderation/queue/ to get a list of all reports with a pending status.

Display Reports: It should display each report in a list, showing the reported message content, the reporter's name, and their comment.

Add Action Buttons: Each report in the queue needs an "Approve" and a "Reject" button.

Clicking "Approve" will call the /api/moderation/review/<report_id>/ endpoint with a request to approve the report.

Clicking "Reject" will call the same endpoint with a request to reject the report.

## 2. Display Karma Scores
The backend now provides a user's karma score. This needs to be displayed in the interface.

Profile Page: The ProfileScreen.js component should be updated to display the karma field that is now available from the /api/user/profile/ endpoint.

Message View: The MessageList.js component could be updated to show the author's karma score next to their name when viewing a message.

## 3. Implement Manual Karma Adjustment (Moderator Tool)
The backend API endpoint for this still needs to be created, but the frontend component would be part of the Moderator Dashboard.

User Management Section: Add a section to the Moderator Dashboard where a moderator can search for a user by nickname.

Adjustment Form: Display the user's current karma and provide an input field to set a new karma value, along with a "Submit" button. This would call the future API endpoint for manual karma adjustment.

Completing these frontend tasks will make the entire moderation, reporting, and karma system fully functional for your users and moderators.
