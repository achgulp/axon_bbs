Version: 10.21.1

Last Updated: 2025-09-27

1. Project Summary
Axon BBS is a federated, anonymous, and modern bulletin board system. The core architecture is a Django backend with a React single-page application frontend. Key systems include a custom P2P data synchronization protocol (BitSync) and a sandboxed applet framework for extensibility. 



2. Immediate To-Do List / Roadmap
This is the prioritized list of features to be implemented next:

Implement User-Managed Applets:

Add an 

owner (ForeignKey to User) and is_active (BooleanField) to the Applet model. 

Create a new frontend view for users to upload and manage their own applets. 

Implement Universal Embed Framework:

Refactor the frontend's 

AttachmentRenderer to dynamically launch viewer applets based on MIME type. 

Integrate Browser History:

Refactor the frontend to use the React Router library to manage navigation and browser history.
