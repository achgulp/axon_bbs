âœ¦ Of course. Here is a summary of where we are:

  We are in the middle of a major backend refactoring to make the project more modular. We've completed Phase 1, where I created the new app structure (accounts,
  messaging, etc.).

  We are currently in Phase 2, which involves moving the database models to their new apps. I have:

   1. Moved the model definitions from core/models.py to their new respective apps.
   2. Updated all the import statements across the project to reflect these new locations.
   3. Created and applied the necessary database migrations to reflect these changes.

  However, the UAT is still failing with a "Server error" when trying to post a message. The logs indicate a database error (no such table: messaging_message), even
  though I have verified that the table does, in fact, exist with the correct name.

  My next step is to continue investigating the root cause of this database error.
