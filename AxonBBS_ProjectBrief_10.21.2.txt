Axon BBS - Project Brief & Development Context (Version 10.21.2)
Version: 10.21.2

Last Updated: 2025-10-02

1. Project Summary
Axon BBS is a federated, anonymous, and modern bulletin board system. The core architecture is a Django backend with a React single-page application frontend. Key systems include a custom P2P data synchronization protocol (BitSync) and a sandboxed applet framework for extensibility.

2. Immediate To-Do List / Roadmap
This is the prioritized list of features to be implemented next:

1.  **Implement Federated Chat (AxonChat):**
    * Build the frontend applet UI for sending and receiving messages.
    * Implement the backend agent logic to federate chat state across the network.

2.  **Implement User-Managed Applets:**
    * Add an `owner` (ForeignKey to User), `is_active` (BooleanField), and `required_access_level` (PositiveIntegerField) to the Applet model.
    * Create a new frontend view for users to upload and manage their own applets.

3.  **Implement Universal Embed Framework:**
    * Refactor the frontend's `AttachmentRenderer` to dynamically launch viewer applets based on MIME type.

4.  **Integrate Browser History:**
    * Refactor the frontend to use the React Router library to manage navigation and browser history.
