Would it make sense and is it possible to make views.py more modulable?



Yes, making views.py more modular is not only possible, but it's an excellent idea and a standard practice for larger Django projects.

As you've seen, the api/views.py file has become very long and difficult to manage. Breaking it up into smaller, more focused files will make the code much easier to read, maintain, and debug.

## How to Modularize views.py
The process involves creating a views directory and splitting the single file into logical modules.

1. Create a New Directory Structure
First, you'll create a new directory (a Python package) to hold the view modules.

Create a new folder named views inside your api directory: axon_bbs/api/views/

Create an empty file inside this new folder named __init__.py.

Move your existing, monolithic views.py file into this new directory.

2. Split the Code into Themed Files
Next, you can split the contents of the large views.py file into smaller, more focused files within the api/views/ directory. A logical way to group them would be:

auth_views.py: For RegisterView, LoginView, UnlockIdentityView, UserProfileView, and the new recovery views.

content_views.py: For MessageBoardListView, MessageListView, PostMessageView, and file handling views like FileUploadView.

moderation_views.py: For ReportMessageView, ModeratorQueueView, ReviewReportView, and BanPubkeyView.

applet_views.py: For all views related to the applet framework, like AppletListView, GetSaveAppletDataView, and PostAppletEventView.

federation_views.py: For the P2P sync views like SyncView and the BitSync protocol views.

3. Update api/views/__init__.py
This is the most important step. To ensure the rest of your application can still find all the views, you need to import them into the __init__.py file.

Full Code for axon_bbs/api/views/__init__.py:

Python

# Axon BBS - A modern, anonymous, federated bulletin board system.
# ... (copyright notice) ...

# This file makes the 'views' directory a Python package and exposes
# all the view classes from their separate modules, so they can still
# be imported from 'api.views'.

from .auth_views import (
    RegisterView,
    LogoutView,
    UnlockIdentityView,
    UserProfileView,
    GetSecurityQuestionsView,
    SubmitRecoveryView,
    # ... and others
)
from .content_views import (
    MessageBoardListView,
    MessageListView,
    PostMessageView,
    FileUploadView,
    FileDownloadView,
    # ... and others
)
from .moderation_views import (
    ReportMessageView,
    ModeratorQueueView,
    ReviewReportView,
    BanPubkeyView,
    # ... and others
)
from .applet_views import (
    AppletListView,
    GetSaveAppletDataView,
    # ... and others
)
from .federation_views import (
    SyncView,
    BitSyncHasContentView,
    BitSyncChunkView,
    # ... and others
)

By doing this, your api/urls.py file does not need to be changed. Its existing from .views import ... statements will now pull from this __init__.py file, which acts as a central hub for all your view classes. This refactoring will significantly improve the organization of your project.
