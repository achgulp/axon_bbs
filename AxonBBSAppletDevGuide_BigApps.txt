You have hit the absolute core of the problem, and you are 100% correct. My apologies. I have been failing because I was trying to brute-force a solution that is simply not feasible due to technical limitations, both within my own processing and within web browsers themselves.

Let's analyze this properly.

The Core Problem: The Single-File Size Limit
You asked, "How big can a JavaScript single app be and still function in a browser?" This is the critical question.

There is no hard, universal file size limit defined in browser specifications. However, there are very real practical and performance limits:

V8 Engine (Chrome/Node.js) String Limit: The V8 engine has a maximum string size, which on a 64-bit system is around 1GB. While our file is much smaller, embedding huge Base64 strings pushes us closer to memory allocation issues.

Browser Memory Cap: Most browsers will crash or become unresponsive if a single tab tries to allocate too much memory. A 5MB file of pure code is manageable, but a file containing 50-100MB of Base64-encoded assets will easily expand to consume several hundred megabytes of RAM once parsed and loaded, especially on mobile devices.

Parsing and Execution Time: Even if the browser can load the file, it must parse and execute that entire script before anything can happen. A script that large will cause a significant, multi-second "white screen" delay, creating a terrible user experience.

My Own Context Limit: As you correctly deduced, I am hitting a processing limit when trying to generate and hold a single file of that immense size in memory. This is why it was being silently truncated, resulting in the small, broken files.

The "all-in-one" approach is a dead end for a game this complex. It was my mistake to continue trying it.

The Correct Solution: A Hybrid Applet Architecture
The Axon BBS architecture itself provides a more elegant solution, which I should have used from the start. Based on the AxonBBSAppletDevGuide_2.0.txt, applets can fetch attachments from the BBS using the bbs.getAttachmentBlob() API call.

This allows us to create a "packaged" applet. It's still a single .js file for execution, but it loads its heavy assets from the BBS itself.

Here is the new, robust architecture:

The Applet (hexgl.js): This will be a much smaller (around 1-2 MB) JavaScript file. It will contain:

All game logic and the Three.js library (all the code).

The HTML and CSS for the UI.

A new asset loader that fetches its data from a separate asset package.

Only tiny UI assets (like the noise background) will be embedded as Base64.

The Asset Package (hexgl_assets.zip): You will upload a single zip file containing all the game's textures, models, and sounds to the Axon BBS as a file attachment.

How It Will Work:
The hexgl.js applet starts.

It uses the bbs.getAttachmentBlob(HASH_OF_ASSET_ZIP) function to request the hexgl_assets.zip file from the BBS.

Once downloaded, it will use a JavaScript library (like JSZip, which I will now include in the applet) to unzip the package in the browser's memory.

It will then read each asset from the in-memory zip file and provide it to the game engine as it's needed.

The game starts.

This approach solves all our problems:

The hexgl.js applet is small enough for me to generate correctly and for browsers to load quickly.

It respects the "no external network calls" rule because it only communicates with the host BBS via the provided API.

It's a standard and highly efficient way to handle large game assets in a web environment.

I am now building this correct version. It will require you to upload the assets separately, but it's the only way to make this work reliably. I will provide both the hexgl.js file and instructions on how to package the assets.
